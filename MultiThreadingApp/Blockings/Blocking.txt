 Blocking

 Block is a multithreading feature that pauses a thread for a specific ammount of time, which will automatically resume running the thread when its reach its threshold.

 Blocking comes into two forms: Sleep() and Join().

 Thread.Sleep():

 Thread.Sleep() pauses the current thread in resides in, and thus halts everything in that space (thread) that come atfer invokation of Thread.sleep(), and waits 
 until the threshold has been meet, which at that point resume running the thread.

 thread.Join()

 thread.Join, unlike Thread.Sleep pauses the space (thread) it placed in, but keeps the sub-thread which inoked the function alive, until its finished, which it 
 then merges back to the main thread resumes running the main thread.
